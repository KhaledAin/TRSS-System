The TRSS-System is a user-friendly desktop application developed to facilitate the rental process and management for rental shops. The system offers intuitive interfaces, efficient tracking mechanisms, automatic communication features, and comprehensive income reporting.

Key Objectives:

•	Develop User-Friendly Interfaces: The project prioritizes intuitive and visually appealing interfaces to ensure ease of navigation and enhance user satisfaction.

•	Rental Process Follow-up Mechanism: The system incorporates features for effective rental process management, including inventory monitoring, reservation handling, rental duration tracking, and seamless returns.

•	Automatic Communication Mechanism: A streamlined communication channel is established between the store and customers, ensuring timely notifications, updates, and reminders related to rentals and reservations.

•	Periodic Income Reports: The system generates periodic reports that provide valuable insights into store income, revenue trends, popular rental items, and support informed decision-making.


Scope of the Project:

The TRSS-System covers the following major functionalities required by rental shops:

1.	Store Tool Panel: Enables the user to have full control over tools in the store, such as adding, updating, deleting, and managing their status, type, and price.

2.	Searching Tool: Allows users to search for specific tools, check their availability, view the number of available tools, and determine the soonest possible time to obtain a tool if it is currently unavailable.

3.	Customer Management: Provides a comprehensive system for managing customer information, including the ability to generate printable contracts.

4.	Periodic Report Generation: Generates weekly and monthly reports that summarize the number and value of leased tools.

5.	Notification Management: Automatically sends reminder messages to customers shortly before the end of the lease term and alerts the store owner if a customer exceeds the agreed-upon return date.

6.	Tools Follow-Up Management: Displays information on tools currently rented and the corresponding customer details, including return dates.


Technology Stack:

The TRSS-System is implemented using the following technology stack:

•	Programming Language: Java

•	Framework: JavaFX

•	Database Management System: MySQL (via phpMyAdmin)

•	Development Environment: XAMPP

•	UI Design Tool: Scene Builder

•	Styling: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

•	Libraries: javax.mail, MySQL Connector/J


Design Pattern:

The TRSS-System is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The MVC pattern separates the application into three interconnected components:

•	Model: Represents the data and logic of the application.

•	View: Responsible for presenting the user interface to the user.

•	Controller: Handles user input, updates the model, and communicates with the view.
